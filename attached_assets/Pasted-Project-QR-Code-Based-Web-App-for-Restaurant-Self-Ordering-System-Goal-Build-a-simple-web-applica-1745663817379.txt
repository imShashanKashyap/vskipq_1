Project: QR Code Based Web App for Restaurant Self-Ordering System

Goal:
Build a simple web application where customers can place orders by scanning a QR code at their table, and chefs can manage orders through their own dashboard — without needing waiters or attendants.

Customer Flow:

Scan QR Code:

Customer sits at a table (example: Table 11).

Scans a QR code placed on the table.

The QR code already contains or passes the table number.

Landing Page After Scanning:

Displays restaurant logo, name, and basic details.

Lists the available food items (menu).

Customer can browse and add items to cart.

Place Order:

Customer provides basic details (like WhatsApp number, pre-filled table number from QR).

No online payment integration for now.

Customer places the order through the web app.

Order Confirmation:

Customer sees a message like:
“Your order has been received and will be ready in 5 minutes!”

Kitchen (Chef) Flow:

Chef Dashboard (Separate Web App View):

Chef logs in and sees new orders coming in real-time.

Each order shows table number, customer details, and ordered items.

Order Processing:

Chef clicks “Accept Order” to start preparing.

Status updates for customer:
“Your order is being prepared.”

Order Completion:

Once food is ready, the chef clicks “Order Ready”.

Notification:

An automatic WhatsApp message triggers to the customer:
“Your order is ready! Please collect it at the counter.”

The customer’s web app also shows order status as “Ready”.

Payment Handling:

No payment is done online.

Customer collects food, pays at the counter directly (cash/card/UPI as per restaurant setup).

Benefits:

Reduces the need for waiters/attendants.

Only 1–2 chefs are needed to manage the entire restaurant flow.

Faster, contactless, and efficient service.

Key Features to Develop:

QR code generation with table mapping.

Customer web view for menu, cart, and ordering.

Chef dashboard for managing and updating order statuses.

WhatsApp API integration for customer notifications.

Real-time status updates between customer and kitchen dashboard.
